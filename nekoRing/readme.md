# mirror of the sites in https://webring.nekoweb.org/onionring-variables.js

i didnt want to include any more js in my homepage.

redirect code grabbed almost verbatim from https://github.com/bucketfish/bucket-webring

if you wanna use it you have to have requested a name from max (and idk how it handles spaces or special characters).
format is: 

previous: https://moosyu.github.io/jsonStorage/nekoRing/redirect.html?to=prev&name=YOURNAME

random: https://moosyu.github.io/jsonStorage/nekoRing/redirect.html?to=random&name=YOURNAME

next: https://moosyu.github.io/jsonStorage/nekoRing/redirect.html?to=next&name=YOURNAME
